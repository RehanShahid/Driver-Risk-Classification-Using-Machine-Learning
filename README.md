PROJECT TOPICS (TEAM 19)

1)	Help insurance companies identify risky and cautious drivers

Abstract:

The total number of automobile accidents and fatalities has been on the increase in most States. Due to this, all drivers are legally required to possess auto accident liability insurance. If a person has had many accidents in the past, car insurance companies logically assume that the person is likely to have more accidents in the future. For this reason, auto insurance companies use the driving record to calculate their risk profile. 
Our solution aims to look at the below data points and identify the risky and cautious auto drivers. 
 -	Previous accident history.
 -	Violations history.
 -	License has been suspended or revoked. 
 -	Other criminal history.
 -	Health record.
 -	Addictions.
 -	Past insurance claims.
 
 
Using this software, insurance companies can gauge the risk based on the driver behaviour score projected in the dashboard. This would suggest the probability of the customer filing a claim against the policy. The more data an insurance company has about the prospective driver, the better the company can guess the quality of the driver.

2)	A mobile dashboard to control all connected IoT devices in the house

Abstract:

The number of IoT devices are increasing rapidly and it is becoming challenging to manage all these devices individually. To make our homes smart, the devices need to have a centralised control system.
Our solution aims to build a dashboard or use voice controlled device like Watson, Alexa, Google Home to control and adjust different smart devices at home like lights, switches, music player, sprinklers. This solution will make our lives easier, more convenient and comfortable.
We plan to implement the following features:
 -	Integrate the control of multiple devices to one platform.
 -	Create the dashboard.
 -	Enable voice controlled interaction with the smart devices.
